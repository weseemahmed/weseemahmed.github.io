In this talk, I discuss with Ontario's Ministry of Finance my latest paper <i>The Canadian Cluster Handbook</i> with a focus on provincial issues. Cluster theory describes how regions specialize around often unique economic activities and by focusing resources and capital into these regional sectors, government can catalyze better local outcomes. In this presentation, I also shared a better way for the Ministry to denote "regions" based on labour flow data rather than population censuses.
