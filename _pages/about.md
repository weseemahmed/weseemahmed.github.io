Hi! I'm Weseem, currently a Research Associate at the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices studying not only how climate change will affect Canadians but also how we can benefit and improve our well-being at the same time. I'm an Economist by training, specializing in environmental economics so my experience modelling combined with my dabbling with lots of data in my research has led me down the data science path. Since then I've been improving my R skills, learned some Python skills, and have begun experimenting building machine learning models and neural networks.

A bit about my work and research

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
