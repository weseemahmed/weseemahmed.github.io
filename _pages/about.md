Hi! I'm Weseem, currently a Research Associate at the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices studying not only how climate change will affect Canadians but also how we can benefit and improve our well-being at the same time. I'm an Economist by training, specializing in environmental economics so my experience modelling combined with my dabbling with lots of data in my research has led me down the data science path. Since then I've been improving my R skills, learned some Python skills, and have begun experimenting building machine learning models and neural networks.

A bit about my work and research
